## 1. RawUberData
This directory contains data on over 5 Lakhs Uber pickups in New York City from April 2014. </br>
- FiveThirtyEight obtained the data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) by submitting a Freedom of Information Law request on July 20, 2015. </br>
- The TLC has sent us the data in batches as it continues to review trip data Uber and other HFV companies have submitted to it.</br>
- The TLC's correspondence with FiveThirtyEight is included in the files TLC_letter.pdf, TLC_letter2.pdf and TLC_letter3.pdf. 
- TLC records requests can be made here.</br>

This data was used for four FiveThirtyEight stories: Uber Is Serving New York’s Outer Boroughs More Than Taxis Are, Public Transit Should Be Uber’s New Best Friend, Uber Is Taking Millions Of Manhattan Rides Away From Taxis, and Is Uber Making NYC Rush-Hour Traffic Worse?.</br>
